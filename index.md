This is a site created during the Carpentry incubator.

- prerequisite skill/ knowledge
- Novices are welcome. We will try and start from scratch, so that everyone have learned the same basics. We will move on together, knowing the same, and developing the understanding of the Zotero together. Aim: all levels should be satisfied by the end of the day.
