This is a site created during the Carpentry incubator.

- prerequisite skill/ knowledge
- Novices are welcome. We will try and start from scratch, but make it a steep learning curve. Aim: all all levels will be satisfied by the end of the day. An important prerequisite would still be that they are open to write the thesis in sometning else than Microsoft Word.
